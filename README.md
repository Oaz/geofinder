This library allows to find the area code for a given pair of coordinates.

NB: I made this to experiment the creation of a npm package.
It merely combines existing packages through a few lines of code.
If you want to use it, you should probably steal these lines of code and
put them into your application.

TL;DR : DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY
